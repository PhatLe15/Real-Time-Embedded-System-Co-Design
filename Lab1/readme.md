# Introduction
  The purpose of this lab assignment is to get familiarized with the MSP432P401R board and its integrated development environment. Specifically, the task is to install the TI SDK and use its provided device driver function to compose and debug on the board.
  
## Exercise 1
  After going through the instructions for this task, there were no issues occured when installing the CCS IDE on Mac.

## Exercise 2
The task for this excercise is to download the driver package and able to compile a sameple `hello world` program. When attempting to download MSP432P4 SDK to the computer, the package did not appear on the folder even after waiting for an hour. The solution for this is to have several attempts to restart the application and press the install button again. If it is successful, the TI folder does not contain the SDK; however, it still appears inside CSS as shown in *Figure 2* below.

```c
#include <ti/devices/msp432p4xx/driverlib/driverlib.h>
/* Standard Includes */
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello World!!!\n");
}
```

## Exercise 3
The task for this excercise is to import a small example project to blink an LED. TI provides many example projects for various microcontrollers. Go Resource Explorer Offline. On the left pane, expand the tree structure from Software to **<Software><SimpleLink MSP432P4 SDK ...><Examples><Development tools><MSP432P401R LaunchPad - Red...><DriverLib><gpio_toggle_output><No RTOS><CCS Compiler><gpio_toggle_output>**. Import the project the same way in the previous exercise. Build and execute the program.

Luckily, no issue occurs in this task.


```c
/* DriverLib Includes */
#include <ti/devices/msp432p4xx/driverlib/driverlib.h>
/* Standard Includes */
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
//![Simple GPIO Config]
int main(void)
{
    volatile uint32_t ii;
    /* Halting the Watchdog */
    MAP_WDT_A_holdTimer();
    /* Configuring P1.0 as output */
    MAP_GPIO_setAsOutputPin(GPIO_PORT_P1, GPIO_PIN0);
    while (1)
    {
        /* Delay Loop */
        for(ii=0;ii<50000;ii++)
        {
        }
        MAP_GPIO_toggleOutputOnPin(GPIO_PORT_P1, GPIO_PIN0);
    }
}
//![Simple GPIO Config]

```

## Exercise 4
For this excercise, the task is to find out some device information about the MCU. There is some specific information about the MCU that is stored in the deviceâ€™s non-volatile memory. They are contained in a table called **Device Descriptor Table**. Consult the MCU datasheet for its address. Create a new project (by importing the example empty project) to read and print the information to the debug console. Just print out the information from the top 3 blocks of the table, i.e., up to the Die Record block (the 3rdblock). There should be 17 data items. Note that each data item is stored as a 32-bit word. 

This task gave a little struggle with the pointer type as well as the printing format that I need to take a good amount of time to review. Overall, this exercise was successful as shown in *Figure 4* below.

    int i;
    printf("     Description                   Address                 Value\n");
    for(i = 0; i < 17; i = i + 1 ){
        printf("%30s                   %08Xh               %08Xh\n",description_arr[i], addr_ptr + (uint32_t)i, *(addr_ptr + (uint32_t)i));
    }
