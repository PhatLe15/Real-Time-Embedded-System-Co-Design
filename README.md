# Real-Time-Embedded-System-Co-Design
Embedded system architecture with real-time operating system including microcontrollers, interfacing techniques for industrial applications using transducers, sensors, and A/D-D/A converters. Hardware/software integration and codesign.

Things I learned from this course:

* Semaphore System Object: I created tasks to control LEDs using semaphores, which gave me a better understanding of the semaphore system object in the TI-RTOS.

* Bit-banding and Timer: I familiarized myself with the bit-banding feature of the MSP432 MCU and used a 32-bit timer to measure elapsed time, which gave me an understanding of the functionality of these components.

* DMA and Interrupts: I worked with the DMA and interrupts functionality on the MSP432 MCU, which improved my understanding of these features.

* Memory Subsystem: I made changes to the contents in the flash memory of the MSP432 MCU to understand the memory subsystem better.

* GPIO and Timer_A: I gained experience with the GPIO's capacitive-touch capacity and the Timer_A module on the MSP432 MCU, using the capacitive-touch capability as an input method to control an LED.

* EnergyTrace and ADC: I used the EnergyTrace tool to understand the power consumption of the MCU and learned how to use the ADC and temperature sensor of the MCU.

* UART Communication: I created tasks and used the TI driver to perform UART communication with external terminal programs, which gave me a better understanding of the TI-RTOS.

These projects have given me hands-on experience in software development, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills. I am confident that my skills and knowledge make me a strong candidate for the Software Engineering role at [Company]. I am eager to apply my experience and further develop my skills in this field.
